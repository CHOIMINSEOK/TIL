# develop environments
#TIL/dev

1. dev: straight forward하다. 개발환경임. 
2. qa: Environment for quality assurance; this provides a less frequently changed version of the application which testers can perform checks against.
3. staging: This is the release candidate, and this environment is normally a mirror of the production environment. The staging area contains the “next” version of the application and is used for final stress testing and client/manager approvals before going live.
4. production: This is the currently released version of the application, accessible to the client/end users. This version preferably does not change except for during scheduled releases.


Staging environments가 좀 생소하네. production으로 내보내기 직전 환경이라..
